Version 1.3 (10 January 2014)
-----------

* Major reworking of pipeline to combine FASTQ records from multiple datasets
  and splitting the sequence data into chunks with a specified number of
  records, corresponding changes to report generation code.

* FASTQ sampling rewritten to use modified version of reservoir sampling method.

* Added option for setting the maximum number of FASTQ records to sample from.

* Added option to create separate reports for each dataset in addition to the
  report for all.

* Added option to specify the minimum number of sequences to display on the
  x-axis of the stacked bar plot in the report.

* Improved scaling for larger image sizes for the stacked bar plot and added
  anti-aliasing for text.

* Removed utility for creating a configuration file from the Solexa LIMS (no
  longer in use).


Version 1.2 (4 February 2013)
-----------

* Fix for failing validation of XML schema definitions.

* New utility for creating the run metadata file by retrieving information
  from the Solexa LIMS via the SOAP API.


Version 1.1 (26 September 2012)
-----------

* Summary report contains new graphical representation of the alignment results
  and different highlighting for spike-in/control samples.

* Fixed bug in which MGA fails if any of the FASTQ sequence data files have no
  sequences.

* Bowtie indexes no longer need to have '.bowtie' preceding the usual suffixes
  (1.ebwt, 2.ebwt, 3.ebwt, 4,ebwt, rev.1.ebwt, rev.2.ebwt)

* Base qualities in the FASTQ sequence data files are now expected to be on the
  Sanger scale, i.e. Phred+33.


Version 1.0 (13 July 2011)
-----------

* First release using workflow system also developed at the CRI and deployed as
  a Java application, replacing the initial prototype developed in ruby.
